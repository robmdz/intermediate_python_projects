# Notes on Python

## Definition of Variable
In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can use the variable name to refer to the object. Unlike other programming languages, Python variables do not have a fixed type, and the same variable can be reassigned to objects of different types.

### Example:

```python
# Assigning a variable
x = 10

# Reassigning to a different type
x = 'Hello'
```

In this example, `x` is initially assigned an integer value `10`, and then it is reassigned to a string `'Hello'`. Unlike statically typed languages, you don't need to declare the type of the variable beforehand.
